# NLW Return | Feedback Widget & Supabase Storage

![banner](banner.png)

> Project carried out at the `NLW Return` event, where we built a feedback widget in which the user can send different types of feedback
> so that the application has a prioritization filtering in the collection of these feedbacks, it can also send a Screenshot of the
> application if you encounter any problems. For the widget to work properly on the web, I used four platforms that offer services
> distinct: `Planet Scale` to scale from a MySQL Database, `Supabase Storage` to generate a valid URL for the image on the web (since some
> email services do not support images in Base64 format), `Railway` to upload the backend of the application and `Vercel` to host the frontend, with
> this practiced promoting settings from a `development environment` to a `production environment`, how to configure environment variables
> and build scripts, in addition to connecting different `Cloud Computing` services existing on the web such as `Backend as a Service (BaaS)`, `Cloud
> Database or Database as a Service (DBaaS)`, `Storage as a Service ( STaaS)` and `Platform as a Service (PaaS)`.
